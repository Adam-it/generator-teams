# Using ngrok for local development and hosting

In order to make development locally a great experience it is recommended to use [ngrok](https://ngrok.io), which allows you to publish the localhost on a public DNS, so that you can consume the bot and the other resources in Microsoft Teams.

To use ngrok, it is recommended to use the `gulp ngrok-serve` command, which will read your ngrok settings from the `.env` file and automatically create a correct manifest file and finally start a local development server using the ngrok settings.
