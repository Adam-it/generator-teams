# <%= title %> - Microsoft Teams App

TODO: Add your documentation here

## Getting started with Microsoft Teams Apps development

Head on over to [Microsoft Teams official documentation](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams) to learn how to build Microsoft Teams Tabs or the [Microsoft Teams Yeoman generator docs](https://github.com/PnP/generator-teams/docs) for details on how this solution is set up.

## Project setup

All required source code are located in the `./src` folder:

* `client` client side code
* `server` server side code
* `public` static files for the web site
* `manifest` for the Microsoft Teams app manifest

For further details see the [Yo Teams documentation](https://github.com/PnP/generator-teams/docs)

## Building the app

The application is built using the `build` Gulp task.

``` bash
npm i -g gulp gulp-cli
gulp build
```

## Building the manifest

To create the Microsoft Teams Apps manifest, run the `manifest` Gulp task. This will generate and validate the package and finally create the package (a zip file) in the `package` folder. The manifest will be validated against the schema and dynamically populated with values from the `.env` file.

``` bash
gulp manifest
```

## Deploying the manifest

TODO


## Configuration

Configuration is stored in the `.env` file.

## Debug and test locally

To debug and test the solution locally you use the `serve` Gulp task. This will first build the app and then start a local web server on port 3007, where you can test your Tabs, Bots or other extensions. Also this command will rebuild the App if you change any file in the `/src` directory.

``` bash
gulp serve
```

To debug the code you can append the argument `debug` to the `serve` command as follows. This allows you to step through your code using your preferred code editor.

``` bash
gulp serve --debug
```

### Debugging with Visual Studio Code

If the application is started with the `--debug` flag, then you can use the built-in debug configurations to step through your code.

* **Debug (Edge)** will open up Edge in remote debugging mode and also connect to the server side for debugging
* **Debug (Chrome)** will open up Crhome in remote debugging mode and also connect to the server side for debugging
* **Attach to server** will only connect to the server side for debugging
* **Launch client (Edge)** will only open up Edge in remote debugging mode
* **Launch client (Chrome)** will only open up Chrome in remote debugging mode

### Using ngrok for local development and hosting

In order to make development locally a great experience it is recommended to use [ngrok](https://ngrok.io), which allows you to publish the localhost on a public DNS, so that you can consume the bot and the other resources in Microsoft Teams.

To use ngrok, it is recommended to use the `gulp ngrok-serve` command, which will read your ngrok settings from the `.env` file and automatically create a correct manifest file and finally start a local development server using the ngrok settings.

### Using Github Codepsaces for development and testing

See TODO for more information

### Additional build options

You can use the following flags for the `serve`, `ngrok-serve` and build commands:

* `--no-linting` or `-l` - skips the linting of Typescript during build to improve build times
* `--debug` - builds in debug mode
* `--env <filename>.env` - use an alternate set of environment files

## Deployment

The solution can be deployed to Azure using any deployment method.

* For Azure Devops see [How to deploy a Yo Teams generated project to Azure through Azure DevOps](https://www.wictorwilen.se/blog/deploying-yo-teams-and-node-apps/)
* For Docker containers, see the included `Dockerfile`

## Logging

To enable logging for the solution you need to add `msteams` to the `DEBUG` environment variable. See the [debug package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug) for more information. By default this setting is turned on in the `.env` file.

Example for Windows command line:

``` bash
SET DEBUG=msteams
```

If you are using Microsoft Azure to host your Microsoft Teams app, then you can add `DEBUG` as an Application Setting with the value of `msteams`.
